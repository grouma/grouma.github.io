title: About

I was born in Canada, but at the age of eight, my family and I moved to Raleigh, NC. I graduated from Athen's Drive High School in 2008 and moved back to Canada to pursue a Bachelor of Science at McGill University.

With the aid of McGill and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, I was able to help create <a href="http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca/">Phylo</a>- A Human Computing Framework for Comparative Genomics. The knowledge and skills gained in that project lead me to an internship with Microsoft where I worked as a Program Manager in the Bing Ads Delivery Engine.

I graduated from McGill University in the spring of 2012 with a joint honours degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Before joining the tech industry, I completed research in computational mathematics. I adapted the synchronous <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html">reverse search algorithm</a> for vertex enumeration/convex hull problems to take advantage of multiple processors/cores. I presented this research at the International Conference on <a href="http://www.cocoa2013.org/">Combinatorial Optimization and Applications</a>.

I currently live in Seattle and work for Microsoft. I initially began work as a Program Manager in Business Intelligence in October of 2012. I have since switched roles to a Software Development Engineer in Data Acquisition. I have the pleasure of working with some incredible open source technology to tackle facinating and challenging problems.
